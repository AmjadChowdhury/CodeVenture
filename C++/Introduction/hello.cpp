    // std â†’ Short for standard. It's the namespace where all standard C++ features (like cout, cin, string, etc.) live.

    // cout â†’ Stands for "character output". It sends data to the standard output device (usually the terminal/screen).

    return 0;
    // return 0; in main() means:
    // "The program ran successfully without errors."
